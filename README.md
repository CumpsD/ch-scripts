This is a collection of userscripts that run on [cryptohopper.com](https://www.cryptohopper.com/?atid=26004) to enhance your experience. Each userscript focuses on one tweak or feature and can be run independently of the others. Run them all or just a few!

## What Is Cryptohopper?

Cryptohopper is an algorithmic trading platform that interfaces with your crypto exchange to trade cryptocurrency on your behalf using market trends, signals, and strategies. It watches the market 24/7 and tries to determine the best time to enter a position and then sell at a predetermined profit target.
